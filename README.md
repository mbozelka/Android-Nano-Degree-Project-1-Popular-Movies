# Android Nanodegree Porject 1 - Popular Movies App Stage 1

Project number one for the Udacity Android Nanodegree. The app pulls in data about popluar movies from https://www.themoviedb.org/.


Important
-------------

https://www.themoviedb.org/ requires you to register for an API key. I am not allowed to share my API key, but you can register to recieve one for free.

Once you have your key you will need to update it in:
`FetchMoviesTask.java`

On line 41 replace YOUR_API_KEY with the key you recived from https://www.themoviedb.org/
`private final String API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";`
